reservations/models.py

Owns exactly two things: the waitlist entry (Reservation) and a small
idempotency log for due-date reminder emails (DueDateReminder).

Deliberately does NOT duplicate anything the `books` (catalog) or `loans`
apps already own:
  - We don't store copy counts here - `books.Book` is the source of truth
    for how many physical copies exist / are available.
  - We don't store loan history here - `loans.Loan` is the source of truth
    for who currently has a book and when it's due.

We reference books.Book via a lazy string FK ("books.Book") so this app has
no hard import-time dependency on the catalog app's module - just a runtime
dependency once migrations run, which is the normal Django pattern for
cross-app FKs.
