reservations/signals.py

Bridges `loans` app events into the waitlist engine. This is the ONLY file
in this app that subscribes to another app's model signals - keep it that
way so the coupling surface stays easy to find and review.

Integration contract with loans (confirm with the loans owner, adjust
`_loan_is_returned` below if their actual field/status names differ):
  - loans.Loan has a `book` FK to books.Book
  - a "book was returned" event is representable as either:
      (a) Loan.status transitioning to a Loan.STATUS_RETURNED-style value, or
      (b) Loan.returned_date being set (previously null)

We use pre_save + post_save together (rather than post_save alone) so we
only fire when a loan actually *transitions into* returned on this save,
not on every subsequent save of an already-returned loan.
